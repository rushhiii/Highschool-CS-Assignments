# CS Assignments

ðŸŽ“ A collection of my high school computer science assignments, projects, and experiments â€” built during Grades 9 to 12.
From basic console apps to interactive games, this repo documents my early journey into programming with Java, Python, and web technologies.
Each project reflects skills I was learning at the time â€” including logic building, loops, functions, file I/O, and UI basics.

This archive isn't just about the code â€” itâ€™s about growth, curiosity, and the start of my path into computer science. ðŸš€
